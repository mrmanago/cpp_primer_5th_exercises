> What is encapsulation? Why is it useful?

From (jaege)[https://github.com/jaege/Cpp-Primer-5th-Exercises/blob/master/ch7/7.18.md]
> Encapsulation enforces the separation between interface and implementation in a class via access specifiers. Encapsulation provides some advantages:
> - A class that is encapsulated hides its implementation to the user of the class, thus the user need not know how the class works, they can regard the class as a type (like a built-in type) instead.
> - User code cannot inadvertently corrupt the state of an encapsulated object.
> - The implementation of an encapsulated class can change over time without requiring changes in user code
