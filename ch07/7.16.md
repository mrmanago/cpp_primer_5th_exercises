> What, if any, are the constraints on where and how often an access specifier may appear inside a class definition? What kinds of members should be defined after a `public` specifier? What kinds should be `private`?

There is no constraint on where or how often an access specifier may appear inside a class. 

Members that need to be accessed by all parts of the program should be preceded by a `public` specifier and ones that don't need to put should be preceded by a `private` specifier.
