> Which, if any, of the following assignments are invalid? If they are valid, explain what they do.
```cpp
int i = 0, &r1 = i;
double d = 0, &r2 = d;
```
> - (a) r2 = 3.14159;
> - (b) r2 = r1;
> - (c) i = r2;
> - (d) r1 = d;

(a): valid. gives d the value 3.14159

(b): valid. gives d the value of i and convert it to a double.

(c): valid but value will be truncated

(d): valid but value will be truncated
