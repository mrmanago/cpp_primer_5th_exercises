> Given the declarations in the previous [exercise](./2.30.md) determine whether the following assignments are legal. Explain how the top-level or low-level `const` applies in each case.

Exercise 2.30:
```cpp
const int v2 = 0;
int v1 = v2;
int *p1 = &v1, &r1 = v1;
const int *p2 = &v2, *const p3 = &i, &r2 = v2;
```

`r1 = v2;` legal. `v2` is a top level `const` but that is irrelevant when copying a value

`p1 = p2;` illegal. `p1` is not a low-level `const` and cannot be assigned the address `p2` has

`p2 = p1;` legal. `p2` is a low-level `const` but that only makes it "think" it's pointing to a `const` and will limit the operations that can be done on `p2`

`p1 = p3;` illegal. `p1` is not a low-level `const` so it cannot point to a top-level `const`
