> Describe the differences in type deduction between `decltype` and auto. Give an example of an expression where auto and `decltype` will deduce the same type and an example where they will deduce differing types.

`auto` is when the compiler deduces the type and `decltype` is when it copies it from another expression. They also hand top-level `const` and references differently.

Example of same type deduction:
```cpp
int a = 0, &r = a;

auto b = a;
decltype(x) c = a;
```

Example of different type deduction:
```cpp
int a = 0, &r = a;

auto b = r;
decltype(r) c = r; 
```
