> Explain each of the following definitions. Indicate whether any are illegal and, if so, why.

```cpp
int i = 0;
```

> (a) `double* dp = &i;`
> (b) `int *ip = i;`
> (c) `int *p = &i;`


(a): illegal. Mismatching types

(b): illegal. Not using the & operator. Pointers hold the address to an object so a & operator is required

(c): legal
