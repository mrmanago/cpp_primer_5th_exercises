(a): Error: Variable must be initialized before using for input
```cpp
int input_value = 0;
std::cin >> input_value;
``` 

(b): Error: 3.14 is not an integer
```cpp
double i = { 3.14 };
```

(c): Error: Cannot initialize salary with the value of wage until wage is declared
```cpp
double wage;
double salary = wage = 9999.99;
```

(d): Legal but value will be 3
```cpp
double i = 3.14;
```
