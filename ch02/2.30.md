> For each of the following declarations indicate whether the object being declared has top-level or low-level `const`.

```cpp
const int v2 = 0; int v1 = v2;
int *p1 = &v1, &r1 = v1;
const int *p2 = &v2, *const p3 = &i, &r2 = v2;
```

`v2` - top-level const
`p2` - low-level const
`p3` - both
`r2` - low-level const
