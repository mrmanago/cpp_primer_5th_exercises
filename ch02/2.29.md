> Using the variables in the previous ## Exercise, which of the following assignments are legal? Explain why.

> (a) `i = ic;`

> (f) `ic = *p3;`

(a): legal

(b): illegal. `p3` points to a `const int`

(c): illegal. `p1` is not a pointer to `const`

(d): illegal. `p3` is a `*const` and the address cannot to be changed

(e): illegal. `p2` is a `*const` and the address cannot to be changed

(f): illegal. `ic` is a `const int` and cannot be changed
