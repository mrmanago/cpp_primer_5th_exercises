1. Differences
int		-32767 to + 3276		16 bits
long	   	-2147483647 to +2147483647	32 bits
long long	-9.22 * 10^18 to +9.22 * 10^18	64 bits
short		-32767 to +32767		16 bits

2. Unsigned and signed
Signed types can be negative or positive numbers.
Unsigned types are greater than or equal to 0.

3. 
float	6 significant digits	32 bits
double	10 significant digits	32 bits
- double-precision operations are faster than single on some machines.
