> What  are  the  differences  between  int, long, long long, and short? Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float anda double?

1. Differences
`int`		-32767 to + 3276		16 bits
`long`	   	-2147483647 to +2147483647	32 bits
`long long`	-9.22 * 10^18 to +9.22 * 10^18	64 bits
`short`		-32767 to +32767		16 bits

2. Unsigned and signed
Signed types can be negative or positive numbers.
Unsigned types are greater than or equal to 0.

3. `float` vs `double`
float	6 significant digits	32 bits
double	10 significant digits	32 bits
- double-precision operations are faster than single on some machines.
