- Arrays have a fixed size 
- Can only be defined with constant types
- Need to leave space for `\0` at the end of strings
- Can not be copied

> Array can not be constructed with the same values like the constructor of vector when defined.
> The size of array must be calculated when using (sometimes cannot be calculated at all) instead of calling a size() method.
