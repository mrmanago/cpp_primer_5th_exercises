>Assuming txt_size is a function that takes no arguments and returns an int value, which of the following definitions are illegal? Explain why.

```cpp
unsigned buf_size = 1024;

int ia[buf_size];
int ia[4 * 7 - 14];
int ia[txt_size()];
char st[11] = "fundamental";
```

(a): illegal. buf_size is not a const type.

(b): legal

(c): illegal. Must be a `constexpr` function

(d): illegal. A string literal has `\0` at the end and therefore it has a size of 12 and not 11.
