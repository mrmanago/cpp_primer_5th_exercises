> Assuming that iter is a `vector<string>::iterator`, indicate which, if any, of the following expressions are legal. Explain the behavior of the legal expressions and why those that arenâ€™t legal are in error.

(a): would dereference `iter` and then increment `iter`
(b): dereference `iter` and then increment it. illegal.
(c): illegal. would try to dereference `iter.empty()`
(d): would check if whatever `iter` points to is empty
(e): illegal. cannot increment a string.
(f): would check if whatever `iter` points to is empty and then increment it.
