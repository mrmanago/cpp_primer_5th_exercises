> Given that `ptr` points to an `int`, that `vec` is a `vector<int>`, and that `ival` is an `int`, explain the behavior of each of these expressions. Which, if any, are likely to be incorrect? Why? How might each be corrected?
```cpp
ptr != 0 && *ptr++
ival++ && ival
vec[ival++] <= vec[ival]
```

(a): checks if ptr is not a nullptr and then checks the pointer value

(b): checks if ival is a non zero

(c): incorrect. ival would be greater after evaluating and it would be >=.
```cpp
vec[ival] <= vec[++ival]
```
