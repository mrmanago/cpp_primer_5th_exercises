(a): 'a' is converted to an `int` then after the operation is converted to a `char`

(b): `ival` is converted to a `double`, then the result of `ival * 1.0` is converted to an `unsigned int, and the it is converted to a `float`

(c): `ui` is converted to a `float`, then the result is converted to a `double`

(d): `ival` is converted to a `float`, then that is converted to a `double`, then that is converted to a `char`
