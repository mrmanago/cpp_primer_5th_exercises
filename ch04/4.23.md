> The following expression fails to compile due to operator precedence. Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), explain why it fails. How would you fix it?
```cpp
string s = "word";
string pl = s + s[s.size() - 1] == 's' ? "" : "s" ;
```

It fails because it returns the value of `s + s[s.size() - 1] == 's'` instead of evaluating the conditional operation.
```
string p1 = s + ((s[s.size() - 1] == 's') ? " " : "s");
```
