> Although the following are legal, they probably do not behave as the programmer expects. Why? Rewrite the expressions as you think they should be.
```cpp
if (p = getPtr() != 0)
if (i = 1024)
```

(a):
It should be:
```
if ((p = getPtr) != 0)
```

(b):
Need to use the equality operator and not the assignment operator.
```
if (i == 1024)
```
