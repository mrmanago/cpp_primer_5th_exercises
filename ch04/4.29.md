> Predict the output of the following code and explain your reasoning. Now run the program. Is the output what you expected? If not, figure out why.
```cpp
int x[10];   int *p = x;
cout << sizeof(x)/sizeof(*x) << endl;
cout << sizeof(p)/sizeof(*p) << endl;
```

`cout << sizeof(x)/sizeof(*x) << endl;` prints 10 and `cout << sizeof(p)/sizeof(*p) << endl;` prints the size of an `int*`
