> Explain when operands are evaluated in the logical `AND`, logical `OR`, and equality operators.

&& `AND`, || `OR`, :
- left then right
- right is only evaluated once the left has. If the left determines the result then the right operand will not be evaluated.

Equality operators :
- both left and right is evaluated
- Left associative so evaluated from left to right if compound
