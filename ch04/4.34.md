> Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what conversions take place in the following expressions:
>
> `(a) if (fval)`
> `(b) dval = fval + ival;`
> `(c) dval + ival * cval;`

(a): `fval` is converted to a `bool`

(b): `ival` is converted to a `float`. `dval` is converted to a `double`

(c): `cval` is converted to an `int`. `dval` is converted to a `double`
