> The `while` loop is particularly good at executing while some condition holds; for example, when we need to read values until end-of-file. The `for` loop is generally thought of as a step loop: An index steps through a range of values in a collection. Write an idiomatic use of each loop and then rewrite each using the other loop construct. If you could use only one loop, which would you choose? Why?

```cpp
// while idiomatic
int i;
while ( cin >> i )
    // ...

// same as for
for (int i = 0; cin >> i;)
    // ...

// for idiomatic
for (int i = 0; i != size; ++i)
    // ...

// same as while
int i = 0;
while (i != size) {
    // ...
    ++i;
}
```
I'd prefer to use `while` if I could only choose one because it can be more easily modifyable and still be readable if I need to iterate over a container.
