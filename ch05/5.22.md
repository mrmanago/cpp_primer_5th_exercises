> The last example in this section that jumped back to begin could be better written using a loop. Rewrite the code to eliminate the goto.
```cpp
// backward jump over an initialized variable definition is okay  
begin:
    int sz = get_size();
    if (sz <= 0) {
        goto begin;
    }
```

```cpp
for (int sz = get_size(); sz <= 0; sz = get_size()) ;
```
or 
```cpp
int sz;
while ((sz = get_size()) <= 0) ;
```
