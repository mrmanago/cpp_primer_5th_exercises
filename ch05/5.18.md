> Explain each of the following loops. Correct any problems you detect.
(a)
```cpp
do
   int v1, v2;
   cout << "Please enter two numbers to sum:" ;
   if (cin >> v1 >> v2)
      cout << "Sum is: " << v1 + v2 << endl;
while (cin);
```

(b)
```cpp
do {
   // . . .
} while (int ival = get_response());
```

(c)
```cpp
do {
   int ival = get_response();
} while (ival);
```

(a):
Added brackets
```cpp
do {
   int v1, v2;
   cout << "Please enter two numbers to sum:" ;
   if (cin >> v1 >> v2)
      cout << "Sum is: " << v1 + v2 << endl;
}while (cin);
```

(b):
Should not declare in a do condition
```cpp
int ival;
do {
   // . . .
} while (ival = get_response());
```

(c):
ival is not declared in the scope of the loop
```cpp
int ival;
do {
   ival = get_response();
} while (ival);
```
