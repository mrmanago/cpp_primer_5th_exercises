> Write three additional declarations for the function in the previous exercise. One should use a type alias, one should use a trailing return, and the third should use `decltype`. Which form do you prefer and why?

```cpp
using ArrT = string[10];
ArrT& func1(ArrT& arr);

auto func2(ArrT& arr) -> string(&)[10];

string arrS[10];
decltype(arrS)& func3(ArrT& arr);
```

I prefer the first one since it is more readable for me.
