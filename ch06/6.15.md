> Explain the rationale for the type of each of `find_char`'s parameters. In particular, why is `s` a reference to `const` but `occurs` is a plain reference? Why are these parameters references, but the `char` parameter `c` is not? What would happen if we made `s` a plain reference? What if we made `occurs` a reference to `const`?

`s` is a reference to `const` because it does not change where as we want `occurs to change in order to calculate how often `char` `c` appears. 
`char` `c` is not a reference because it's a temp variable.
If `s` was a normal reference then the value of `s` would change and if `occurs` was a reference to `const` then the intended program could not function correctly.
