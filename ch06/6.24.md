> Explain the behavior of the following function. If there are problems in the code, explain what they are and how you might fix them.
```cpp
void print(const int ia[10]) {
	for (size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
		cout << ia[i] << endl;
}
```

There is no way to guarantee that `ia` will be initialized with 10 elements so we need to change the function so that it ensures only an array of 10 elements will be passed through.
```cpp
void print(const int (&ia)[10])
{
	for (size_t i = 0; i !=10; ++i)
		cout << ia[i] << endl;
}
```
