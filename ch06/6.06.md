> Explain the differences between a parameter, a local variable, and a local `static` variable. Give an example of a function in which each might be useful.

**parameter**:
- initialized by arguments passed through
- automatic objects

**local variable**:
- parameters
- automatic objects
- variables defined in the function body
- override declarations of the same name made in an outer scope

**local `static` variable**:
- lifetime does not end after the function block has been executed
- continues across calls to the function
- initialized before the first time the function block has been executed
- destroyed when the program terminates

```cpp
int countAdd(int n)
{
	static int count = 0;
	count += n;
	return count;
}

int main()
{
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
		cout << countAdd(1) << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
```
