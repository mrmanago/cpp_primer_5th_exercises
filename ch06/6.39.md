> Explain the effect of the second declaration in each  ne of the following sets of declarations. Indicate which, if any, are illegal.
> (a)
```cpp
int calc(int, int);
int calc(const int, const int);
```
> (b)
```cpp
int get();
double get();
```
> (c)
```cpp
int *reset(int *);
double *reset(double *);
```

(a): legal but only the 2nd one will be used. Function declaration is allowed multiple times without definition.

(b): illegal. The functions only differ by their return type

(c): legal. One reset takes an `int*` and the other takes a `double*`
