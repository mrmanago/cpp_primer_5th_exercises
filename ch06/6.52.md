> Given the following declarations,
```cpp
void manip(int, int);
double dobj;
```
> what is the rank of each conversion in the following calls?
> (a) manip('a', 'z');
> (b) manip(55.5, dobj);

(a): Match through a promotion. `'a'` and `'b'` are promoted to an `int`.
(b): Arithmetic type conversion. `55.5` and `dobj` are truncated and converted to an `int`.
