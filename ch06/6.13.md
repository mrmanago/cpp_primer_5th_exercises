> Assuming `T` is the name of a type, explain the difference between a function declared as `void f(T)` and `void f(T&)`.

`f(T)` is passing an argument by value and therefore will only use a copy of T and not change the value of T.

`f(T&)` is passing an argument by reference and the variable will become an alias for T. Any operations on the alias will change the value of the variable type T.
