> The following function, although legal, is less useful than it might be. Identify and correct the limitation of this function:
```cpp
bool is_empty(string& s) { return s.empty(); } 
```

If `is_empty` used a reference to `const` then it would also be able to take `const` strings as an arguement and not just mutable strings.
```cpp
bool is_empty(const string& s) { return s.empty(); }
```
