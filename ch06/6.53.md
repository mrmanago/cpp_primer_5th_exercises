> Explain the effect of the second declaration in each one of the following sets of declarations. Indicate which, if any, are illegal.
> (a):
```cpp
int calc(int&, int&);
int calc(const int&, const int&);
```
> (b):
```cpp
int calc(char*, char*);
int calc(const char*, const char*);
```
> (c):
```cpp
int calc(char*, char*);
int calc(char* const, char* const);
```

(a): Overloads `calc` and allows `const int` references to be passed through.

(b): Overloads `calc` and allows `const char` references to be passed through.

(c): Illegal, both lookup `char*`
