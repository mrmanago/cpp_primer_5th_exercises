> Given the declarations for `f` from page 242, list the viable functions, if any for each of the following calls. Indicate which function is the best match, or if the call is illegal whether there is no match or why the call is ambiguous.
```cpp
void f();
void f(int);
void f(int, int);
void f(double, double = 3.14);
```
> (a) `f(2.56, 42)`
> (b) `f(42)`
> (c) `f(42, 0)`
> (d) `f(2.56, 3.14)`

(a):
Viable functions:
```cpp
void f(int, int);
void f(double, double = 3.14);
```
Illegal. It is ambiguous because `2.56` is a double but `42` matches with the type `int`

(b):
Viable functions:
```cpp
void f(int);
void f(double, double = 3.14);
```
The first one matches the type and amount exactly so that one would be the best match.

(c):
Viable functions:
```cpp
void f(int, int);
void f(double, double = 3.14);
```
The first one matches the type and amount exactly so that one would be the best match.

(d):
Viable functions:
```cpp
void f(int, int);
void f(double, double = 3.14);
```
The second one matches the type and amount exactly so that one would be the best match.
