> When you use an `initializer_list` in a range `for` would you ever use a reference as the loop control variable? If so, why? If not, why not?

You'd never use a plain reference because `initializer_list` elements are a `const` type but you may want to use a reference to `const` if the elements are a large data type since it would be cheaper than copying.
