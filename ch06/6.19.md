> Give the following declarations, determine which calls are legal and which are illegal. For those that are illegal, explain why.
```cpp
double calc(double);
int count(const string &, char);
int sum(vector<int>::iterator, vector<int>::iterator, int);
vector<int> vec(10);
```
> (a) `calc(23.4, 55.1);`
> (b) `count("abcda", 'a');
> (c) `calc(66);`
> (d) `sum(vec.begin(). vec.end(), 3.8);`

(a): illegal. Too many arguments to parameters

(b): illegal. a const string& cannot be initialized with a string literal

(c): legal

(d): legal but 3.8 will be truncated.
