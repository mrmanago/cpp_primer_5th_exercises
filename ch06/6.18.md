> Write declarations for each of the following functions. When you write these declarations, use the name of the function to indicate what the function does.
> (a) A function named `compare` that returns a `bool` and has two parameters that are references to the class named `matrix`.
> (b) A function named `change_val` that returns a `vector<int>` iterator and takes two parameters: One is an `int` and the other is an iterator for a `vector<int>`.

(a):
```cpp
bool compare(matrix&, matrix&);
```

(b):
```cpp
vector<int>::iterator change_val(int, vector<int>::iterator);
```
