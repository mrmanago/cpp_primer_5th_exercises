> Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.
```
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
	  << " and " << v2;          
          << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
```

The program above is not legal. The semicolon marked the end of the statement. the `<<` operator is a member of std::cout and cannot be called without the object `std::cout`. To fix it, simply remove the semicolons.

Fixed program:
```
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1
	  << " and " << v2          
          << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
```
