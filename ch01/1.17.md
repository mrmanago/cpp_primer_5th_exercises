> What happens in the program presented in this section if the input values are all equal? What if there are no duplicated values?

```
#include <iostream>
int main(){
   int currVal = 0, val = 0;
   if (std::cin >> currVal) {
      int cnt = 1;
         while (std::cin >> val) { 
            if (val == currVal)
	       ++cnt;
	    else { 
	       std::cout << currVal << " occurs "<< cnt << " times" << std::endl;
	       currVal = val;
	       cnt = 1;
	    }
	 }
      std::cout << currVal <<" occurs "<< cnt << " times" << std::endl;
   }
   return 0;
}
```

If the consequential inputs are equal then it states how many times you inputted that value.
If the inputs are different it just lists them out and appends " occurs 1 times" to each value.
